= Micronaut Security

This project showcases how to test secured Micronaut applications.

We use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut Security] to do that.
Micronaut Security offers the possibility to secure your application on the HTTP layer.

E.g. https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security] offers additionally to secure you business logic and not just your Web-Controllers (See https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/method-security.html#page-title[Method Security]).
If you think the author is mistaken and Micronaut Security offers this as well, do not hesitate to open a bug.

== What do we showcase?

We showcase how to use Basic Authentication, which is enabled by default.

In addition to that we offer JWT based Authentication, too.

We show two different ways to secure your endpoints:

* `io.micronaut.security.annotation.Secured`
* https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#interceptUrlMap[Intercept URL map]
